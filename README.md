# Smart-lock-using-Raspberry-Pi

In the word file you will find all the steps needed to implement. You will find the required knowledge along with the code in an organized manner.
First you will learn about the Raspberry Pi and its functioning, the various components associated with it. 
Then we will come towards the software part in which I have given a step by step prodcedure to install all the dependencies and OpenCV as wwll.
After this we will detect faces using Haar Cascade Classifier from OpenCV. 
Then I have listed all the knowledge required about the hardware aspect of this project.
And then finally I have talked about the future scope of this project as well.
There is a link to the video in which the lock is working properly in the .txt file.
